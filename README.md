### Data Preparation Process 
Data preparation, also known as data preprocessing, is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves transforming raw data into a format that can be used for analysis. The data preparation process here included:

Data cleaning: This involves identifying and correcting errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the data. It may also involve removing duplicates and redundant data.

Data transformation: This involves converting the data into a form that is suitable for analysis, which included the 'DATE' variable converted into datetime type. This also includes renaming as well, since some columns needed to be renamed. 

Data selection: This involves select subsets of the DataFrames to retrieve the information we want. 

Data plotting: This involves creating visuals to represent data using graphs, charts, and other types of visualizations. It is apart data analysis because it allows us to easily see patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
