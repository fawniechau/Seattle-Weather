### Data Preparation Process 
The data preparation process here included:

- converted necessary data types, which included the 'DATE' variable converted into datetime type

- properly renamed columns 

- new dataframe for precipitation data was narrowed to be between 2018-2022 for both St. Louis and Seattle

- selected subsets of the DataFrames to retrieve the information we want. St. Louis data was also reframed to be between 2018-2022 and one weather station, just like Seattle's. 

- identified and imputed missing values with the mean across years of values on that day.

### Data Analysis Process 
The data analysis process here included:  

- sub-questions about the project were generated for the analysis portion 

- with our new clean dataset, plots and graphs were generated by creating new dataframes 

- conclusion included the answers to the sub-questions from before
